# Enumerables methods

**In this project, I implement my own version of Ruby’s enumerable methods**

>Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there’s no magic to it, I rebuilt those methods.
